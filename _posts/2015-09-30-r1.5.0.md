The 1.5.0 release adds multi-track support to ExoPlayer. For each renderer, it's now possible to
query the number of available tracks and their formats using `ExoPlayer`'s new `getTrackCount(int)`
and `getTrackFormat(int, int)` APIs. Track selection can be performed using the new
`setSelectedTrack(int, int)` API, and `getSelectedTrack(int)` can be used to query the current
selection for a given renderer.

Other notable improvements in 1.5.0 include smoother format adaptation and support for MP3 media
segments in HLS, as well as limited support for multi-period manifests in DASH. The release notes
can be found below.
